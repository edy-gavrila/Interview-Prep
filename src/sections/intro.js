        "Hello, reader! I see you have stumbled upon my humble blog! Now that you are here, let me explain what you will find here. This is a blog that keeps track of my JavaScript learning journey, specifically, mastering the JavaScript interview questions.",

        "I already have a ton of hands-on JavaScript experience and I know a lot of concepts. The trouble is, I have difficulty expressing clearly these concepts, when asked by an interviewer. My aim is to express these concepts clearly and concisely so the interviewer has no doubt that I do master those concepts.",

        "Why should you read on? Firstly you can learn a lot of JavaScript stuff as I intent to write here anything that I am trying to learn to explain. Secondly, if you are preparing for a technical interview yourself, I am planning to explain how I found my journey to be, what I learned from it and were my mistakes.",

        "I have decided to learn web development in December 2021. Previously I had a little bit of coding experience from high school, were I took a computer science class. I learned about data structures, computer architecture, algorithms, data representation. As a programming language we did Pascal and C++. ",

        "After high school life took a different turn and I didn't continue programming, although I enjoyed it very much. Not being able to go to the university, I didn't think there is a avenue where I could access a programming job. At least not in these days, in 2007.",

        "Things have changed since then and the job market is no longer inaccessible for the self-taught hacker. I found out this from Twitter. I discovered a great community where people shared tips, learning resources, like articles, YouTube videos and Udemy courses. For me there was one thing to do: Get started!",

        "I knew I had to start from the basics. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So I jumped on FreeCodeCamp (google it!) and cracked on. It wasn't easy but one big advantage was that I could see the fruits of my learning almost immediately, by building small projects.",

        "After the basics I did the Algorithms and Data Structures part on FreeCodeCamp. Being armed with the basics of Web Development, I started learning a framework I've heard great things of: React.js. That was quite a leap. It took weeks to get my head around it. When finally, it clicked, It was one of the nicest feelings I've ever had.Frameworks like React, brings you to the next level of Web Development.",

        "Learning more and more, I decided I want to be a full-stack web developer. That means writing code that runs in the browser, as well as writing code that runs on the server. I found about a great free full-stack course, The Odin Project (again, google it!) and I jumped straight on it, in parallel with a React Course on Udemy. For the back-end part, I decided to learn the Ruby programming language which it was a mistake. Later I realised that learning LavaScript and Ruby at the same time was too much for me. I went back on the course and started learning JavaScript for the back-end.",
